# Black-n-White

Black'n'White is a small logic game in which all fields are to be brought into a uniform color - either black or white.

If you click on a field, the color of the field changes to the opposite color. This also happens in the neighboring fields. Depending on the setting, the linear neighboring fields or the diagonal neighboring fields are changed. But both are also possible. The larger the field, the more difficult it is to solve and the longer the game takes.

The goal is to solve the game with as few clicks and ticks as possible.

The game is based on an idea by Sascha Seidel: http://www.saschaseidel.de/html/eigeneprogramme/eigeneprogramme.php#Black_and_White
